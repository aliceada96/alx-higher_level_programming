# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project,i am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Why Python programming is awesome
What are sets and how to use them
What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
When to use sets versus lists
How to iterate into a set
What are dictionaries and how to use them
When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
What is a key in a dictionary
How to iterate over a dictionary
What is a lambda function
What are the map, reduce and filter functions

## Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

0. Squared simple

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
Returns a new matrix:
Same size as matrix
Each value should be the square of the value of the input
Initial matrix should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You are allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

1. Search and replace

Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
my_list is the initial list
search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element
You are not allowed to import any module

2. Unique addition

Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[]):
You are not allowed to import any module

3. Present in both

Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
You are not allowed to import any module

4. Only differents

Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):
You are not allowed to import any module

5. Number of keys

Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary):
You are not allowed to import any module

6. Print sorted dictionary
mandatory
Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
Only sort keys of the first level (don’t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
Dictionary values can have any type
You are not allowed to import any module
